To run the program, follow the instructions
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

 1) Run Makefile on the terminal.

 2) Type ./sorting to execute the program.

 3) The system will display options for the user to select
    which are  

	[1]     Insertion sort           
	[2]     Selection sort
      [3]     Merge sort    
	[4]     Quick sort
      [5]     Exit 

 4) When you typed the algorithm that you want to test,
    the system will ask for the number of elements.

 5) The system will generate the list of random integers
    between 0 to 1,000,000 for the list and then prints
    the elements of the array before sorting.

 6) The system will call responsible function to sort the
    array with the selected algorithm and then print the
    elements of the array after sorting together with 
    the running time.
